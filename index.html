They also left WALL·E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class) robots on Earth to clean up and compact all the industrial waste. Only one WALL·E remains, it which has gained emotions and the ability to feel. In order to survive emotionally, WALL·E uses whatever it can find as touchstones to past life on Earth.

Not knowing about EVE's mission, WALL·E is surprised by EVE's interest in a small seedling WALL·E previously found and brought back to its makeshift abode. In EVE needing to take the seedling back to Axiom, WALL·E, not wanting to lose its new friend, hitches a ride as a stowaway to Axiom.
